Learnings from the project

Engaging in a website creation project gave me a multifaceted learning experience. I learnt the art of effective focusing on a particular thing for a long time. Technical skills 
flourished as i navigated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enhancing my proficiency in web development.Problem solving became my second nature during the period i worked on the project troubleshooting, codding challenges and optimizing user Interface.Moreover version control tools like Git provided insight into project management.
This journey not only expanded my technical skills but also cultivated soft sskills amplifying the value of hands on learning.
